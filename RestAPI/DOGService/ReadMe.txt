DOGService REST API ReadMe.txt mtm 11-22-2016

The REST API is Azure deployed (currently) through a Visual Studio 2015 project connected to Azure

It uses WebAPI2 and will execute against Azure (Initial Cloud Platform),
the REST API may expand to incorporate Google Cloud and AWS Cloud functionality

Decision to use C# and .NET code for interacting, initially, based on author back-end coding experience

Branching out to use NodeJS, or to use the WebAPI to interface with NodeJS, or even Ansible via C# calls
is T.B.D.
